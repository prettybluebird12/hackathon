**Surviving during a hurricane**
- Evacuate. Do not drive around barricades
- Go to a FEMA safe room, ICC 500 storm shelter, or a small, interior, windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor that is not subject to flooding.
- Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising flood water.
